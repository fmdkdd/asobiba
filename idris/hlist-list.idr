-- Can't unify True with lte (S (fromInteger 2)) (length [])

-- Why does it not reduce `lte`?  Because there is a missing implicit
-- in `length`: the type of the elements of the list.

-- > indexImpl 2 [] {ok=Refl} {a=Int}
-- Can't convert True = True with False = True

-- But, I cannot find a way to prove that indexImpl is total.  We are
-- missing the case of any Nat with the empty list, but Idris does not
-- seem convinced this is impossible.  Maybe the middle is not
-- excluded?
-- indexImpl _  [] {ok=(False = True)} impossible
