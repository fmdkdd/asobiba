A repository for toy ideas that do not deserve their own repository.

Some files contain comments that might elaborate on what I was trying
to achieve.  Most don’t.  But even the commented ones might not make
any sense.

The repository name is Japanese for ‘playground’; you should not take
any code in there seriously.
